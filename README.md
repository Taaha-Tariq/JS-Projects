# Javascript Programs:
+ DNA simulator
+ Random Message Generator

## Description:

These programs are written in Javascript and do as the names suggest. Every step is explained with comments in the code. Plus, they are written using the best ongoing practices in javascript.

## Why did i write them?

I wrote these programs for improving my logical thinking and my coding and programming skills.
For, as they say:
> The best way to get good at something is to do it as many times as it takes.

## How to download and run them?

On the top right corner above the programs, there is a green button with **Code** written on it. Press it and save the url that shows up in the dropdown bar.
Then clone the directory using the command :

>$ git clone copied_url

By doing this, it will clone the repository from Github onto your computer and then you'll need a javascript runtime environment (*Node.js*) to run the code on your computer.
After downloading it, You can run the code with the command :
 
>$ node File_name

Feel free to play around and change the codes as you wish. *Good Luck*
